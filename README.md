# FileManagement
File Management scripts I've made as I've needed. I'm just going to dump them here for future reference and if it helps out anyone else

## Mass folder renaming
I ended up with loads of assets, but their folders were named as random strings. This goes through all the folders in the specified directory (set in the code "folder_path", make sure you double slash), gets the first file in there and sets the first part of that name to the name of the folder. I had loads of assets, with textures inside. The naming convention was pretty standard, NAME_.... so I just look for the first underscore and get that part of the string



### DISCLAIMER
These work for my use, don't use them unless you know what you're doing or have a backup, just in case something goes wrong. This is changing file names.
